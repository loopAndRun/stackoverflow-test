## Small summary

- Welcome to our small application, designed to make it easy for you to display top 10 question from stackoverflow based on votes.

- I tried to follow best practices, including S.O.L.I.D principles and Declarative programming, to ensure the app is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

- I prioritized the use of observables and async pipes to manage the data streams, making it easier to handle data in real-time. Additionally, we included a small responsive design for different screen sizes, using the versatile Tailwind CSS library. We chose Tailwind because it allows us to include only the necessary classes in the build bundle, making the app more lightweight and faster to load.

- To ensure the app is reliable and error-free, we used ng-mock and observer-spy for testing. These tools are essential for simplifying the testing process and ensuring that all aspects of the app function as expected.
